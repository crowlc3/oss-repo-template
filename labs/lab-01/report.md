* Open Source Definition: The 10 criteria of the open source definition explain all of the essential rules an open source project must follow to be succesful. Most of this reading discussed how the license should be structured to ensure that people can properly access and utilize these softwares. It seems that formulating the license properly is one of the most important parts of open source software. I also didn't realize how important it is to make sure the software doesn't disciminate groups of people. This never occured to me that it could be a software issue but it makes a lot of sense. If you make a project that is advertised to be free to the public and to add some sort of intellectual value to its community, but it is impossible to use at certain companies than it is disciminatory.
* Smart Questions - How to ask the question The Smart Way: I must admit that when I read through this, for most of the reading I felt like the author was yelling at me and insulting me. However, as I kept reading I noticed that the point of writing this way is to show that dumb questions can really hinder communities learning progress, and eventually people become really annoyed with the lack of effort. I am definitely guilty of asking questions that I can figure out for myself. Seemingly one of the author's biggest pet peeves was when people ask questions that can easily be answered with one Google search...which is definitely something I have done. I very much liked the section where the author described how to formulate an email header to grab the reader's attention properly. I will be using the "Object-Deviation" method in the future.
* From my past experience the twoo suggestions for "How to Answer Questions in a Helpful Way" would be
  - Give encouragement to people like "Good question!". In my experience, this helps me formulate future questions that will be more accurate and helpful.
  - If the question was asked in a poor way, with a good question hidden inside of it, help rewrite it so in the future the user will know how to write a more on topic question.
