* Open Source Definition: The 10 criteria of the open source definition explain all of the essential rules an open source project must follow to be succesful. Most of this reading discussed how the license should be structured to ensure that people can properly access and utilize these softwares. It seems that formulating the license properly is one of the most important parts of open source software. I also didn't realize how important it is to make sure the software doesn't disciminate groups of people. This never occured to me that it could be a software issue but it makes a lot of sense. If you make a project that is advertised to be free to the public and to add some sort of intellectual value to its community, but it is impossible to use at certain companies than it is disciminatory.
* Smart Questions - How to ask the question The Smart Way: I must admit that when I read through this, for most of the reading I felt like the author was yelling at me and insulting me. However, as I kept reading I noticed that the point of writing this way is to show that dumb questions can really hinder communities learning progress, and eventually people become really annoyed with the lack of effort. I am definitely guilty of asking questions that I can figure out for myself. Seemingly one of the author's biggest pet peeves was when people ask questions that can easily be answered with one Google search...which is definitely something I have done. I very much liked the section where the author described how to formulate an email header to grab the reader's attention properly. I will be using the "Object-Deviation" method in the future.
* From my past experience the twoo suggestions for "How to Answer Questions in a Helpful Way" would be
  - Give encouragement to people like "Good question!". In my experience, this helps me formulate future questions that will be more accurate and helpful.
  - If the question was asked in a poor way, with a good question hidden inside of it, help rewrite it so in the future the user will know how to write a more on topic question.
* Chapter 3 of Free Culture: I think this horrible, terrifying story is a perfect example of how little people know about the internet. I have met many people who have tinkered with seemingly public data/software who later find out the hard way that what they are doing is actually wrong. I think this problem is a combination of laziness and ignorance from so many different communities. The most essential part of a student here at RPI is their desire to learn and grow. We don't just sit and let the waves of homework crash over us, we research and we invent. This story is a terrifying glimpse into the unfair reality of not having proper safeguards to protect intellectual property. If what Jesse did was so horrendous, why was he not aware before he even began? For the computer science community as a whole it is imperitave that people take proper precautions with their work to avoid curious students falling into this same rabbit hole.


##6. Reflection

Currently I am interested in 3 open source projects
* TensorFlow Playground: https://opensource.google/projects/tensorflow-playground
  - This seems to be a well established website where you can visualize neural networks. I just recently learned about neural networks and I find them very interesting so I think this could be a really cool project. Their sourcecode is on GitHub and there are lots of discussions online about this project, as well as many lesson plans actually using TensorFlow Playground.
* Zotonic: http://aosabook.org/en/posa/zotonic.html
  - Zotonic is a framework for doing full stack web development. When I was a part of RCOS I encountered full stack web development on the team I was working on and I think that a framework to actually encapsulate the whole process would be really cool. Zotonic has its source code sitting on GitHub.
* Yara: https://opensource.google/projects/yara
  - Yara is a tool to help classify and identify malware samples. I have always found malware very interesting and I have wanted to get deeper into researching it but I have not had the chance.
