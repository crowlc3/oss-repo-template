## Four Criteria for Free Software

The four criteria for free software explain the requirments software must have for it to actually qualify as "free software". I think these criteria are important to have explicitly stated because it does not allow people to miss certain aspects of having free software, which could then hinder someones ability to use/study the software. For example, if a software is labeled as free software, but it cannot be edited, then someone trying to do their own research and figure out all the nooks and crannies of a particular program by editing and modifying the code would not be able to do so, even though the software might have been labeled "free".

## Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?

Sometimes developers make code with specific uses in mind. They might publish their code publicly, but not want anyone to make changes to it. Or, they may want anyone to be able to change and distribute it. With a license a developer can explicitly state how they want their code to be utilized. Licenses are important also for long term projects. You may not really know how serious a project might become, and without a license you might be making it harder for yourself in the future to take back control of your code.

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

When a project has a license, you know the permissions you have when using the software. You know exactly how/if you can study, modify, and redistribute the software. If there is no explicit license then the developer has all rights reserved to their code. This means that by default the work is under exclusive copyright to the developer. You might be using code that you have no right using!

## Why the Web beat Gopher: Failure to Follow the Open System Model

I think something important that the Gopher team failed to realize was who exactly was going to use/benefit from their software. If you create an enviornment around your product that seemingly discriminates against the exact people who are going to use your product, you create a hostile enviornment that no one wants to participate in. I think that releasing software to the public early to get feedback from talented developers is super important for projects. I agree with the claim that this article made and I think they provided a great example of why their claim is valid.

## Why a MIT License was chosen for .NET Core

The MIT License states that you can basically do whatever you want with the code as long as you include the original license notice in any copies. When you first go to the .NET Core GitHub, there is immediately a section in their README that states  

- How can I contribute?  
- Reporting security issues and security bugs.  

This project is welcoming testing, and edits to their software as soon as you open their page. When you read up about how to contribute to their code (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), they provide many different instructions on how to contribute changes properly to their software, how the workflow of changes should be structured, how to format commit messages, where you can find possible issues that need resolving. In addition, this project is a part of the .NET foundation. This foundation advocates for the needs of .NET open source developers. They promote community involvment to their variety of projects.  

.NET Core website: https://dotnetfoundation.org/about

When you put all of this together it makes sense why they are using a license that allows any user to freely contribute and test their software.
