## Checkpoint 2: Executing the Tests

### Visiting the CMake dashboard:
1. Find the Nightly and Experimental sections and look at some of the submissions. How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission?
  - You can see what tests were run by clicking on the "passing tests" number and it will then show you which tests were ran. For example, I clicked on a random "passing test" number in the experimental section and saw this.

2. Find a submission with errors. Can you see what the error condition was? How does this help you debug the failure?
  - If you click on the "failing tests" number and then click further into the failing test for more details, it shows a small message explaining why it is an error.
  - ![Failing Message](/Images/Lab07Images/failingmessage.png)
3. Find a system that is close to your specific configuration in the Nightly, Nightly Expected or one of the Masters sections. How clean is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with?
  - All of the dashboards that I have seen seem to be clean. No errors to be concerned with.

My build is the top TABLET submission.
