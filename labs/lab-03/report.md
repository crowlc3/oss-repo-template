- GitStats  

![gitstats](/Images/Lab03Images/gitstats.jpg)  
As you can see from the git stats, the amount of lines of code was completely different than the results from "git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l". This seems to show a lot more lines than git stats. In addition, it says there were 7 authors however the repo only shows 5 contributors.  



- Gource

Gource was really cool to use. As you can see from the video, the user shinoka7 was super active in this project. It was also cool to see visually how long this project has been around.
